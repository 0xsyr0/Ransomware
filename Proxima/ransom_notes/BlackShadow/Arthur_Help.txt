What guarantee is there?
To test our ability to return files, send us two unimportant random small files in any format.
We will decrypt them and give them back to you for free.
That is what we guarantee.

We have also collected private and highly sensitive data from your servers.
This information is now kept on our private servers.
Once the payment has been received, these servers will be instantly deleted.

In case you don't pay, we auction off your files to potential buyers on a number of DarkNet websites.
Following that, we use email and any other contacts of your clients to inform them of what happened;
Possibly they will be interested in buying your data individually.

Data leaks are a serious violation of the law.
However if you pay, this incident will be kept private, and the data will be preserved.

We have no political aims and are not attempting to damage your reputation.
This is our business.The only things that matter to us are money and our reputation.
We target companies worldwide, excluding hospitals and medical care facilities, which are our red lines.
