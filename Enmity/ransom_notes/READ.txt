Greetings,

Your files have been encrypted, and your sensitive data has been exfiltrated. To unlock your files and prevent the release of your data on the internet, a payment is required. Please note that the cost for file decryption and preventing data publication are separate.

To establish trust and provide assurance, we offer the following:

A decryption test for a few small files (less than 1-2 MB) that do not contain valuable information.
Screenshots of other customers who have paid and received decryption. For larger payments, you may also request contact information for individuals from your country who have successfully decrypted their data as proof.
Pricing:

Single Servers: $3,000 to $10,000, depending on the data.
Companies and Multiple Computers: $20,000 to 2 BTC, depending on the data size and company.

Delaying contact will increase the cost and make it more difficult for you.
