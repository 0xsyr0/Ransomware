|-[ All your data were encrypted by TR4CK Ransomware. ]
|
|-If you try to decrypt them yourself, you will lose your data. To decrypt all systems, you need to contact us for guidance and a data recovery tool in the future. If you ignore our offer and the conversation does not take place, we will take extreme measures against your company and your employees, as a result of which you will lose access to all resources of your network and lose your reputation.
|
|-To contact us - register your mail here: https://account.proton.me/mail/signup?plan=free and write to us by email: [redacted]@proton.me
|-Further negotiations regarding this situation will be conducted there.
|
|-Be sure to use a VPN, and do not attempt to write from other email addresses, as there is a high chance that the messages will not be delivered to either party.
|
|-You have 48 hours to contact us to establish negotiations and interaction, starting from the date of creation of this file.
|-If you do not contact us within 2 days, we will consider this a refusal to cooperate. This will entail immediate measures, such as: leaking personal data of your employees, their correspondence in messengers and social networks, the credentials of your colleagues and internal company documents. We have exfiltrated over 2 terabytes of your clients' personal data from your network. Active client database dumps (for example, a Bitrix client database of 400,000+ clients) are already being processed by our analysts to identify officials, oligarchs, and other "fat clients" who could become targets for call centers.
|
|-Warning:
_ Do not delete, modify, or attempt to recover files by any means other than using our key and decryptor. This will damage your data, and we cannot guarantee its recovery.
_ Do not try to make this public, as you will only harm yourself and your reputation.
