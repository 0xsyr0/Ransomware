some notes:
1-although illegal and bad but this is business,you are our client after infection and we will treat you respectfully like a client
2-do not play with encrypted file, take a backup if you want to waste some time playing with them
3- if you take a random middle man from internet he may take you money and not pay as and disappear or lie to you
4-police can't help you , we are excpericed hackers and we don't leave footprints behind , even if we did police wont risk ther million dollar worth zero day exploits for catching us, instead what they do get sure of is you never pay us and you suffer loss your data
5-if some of your files don't have our extention but do not open ,they are encrypted all other files and will decrypt normally ,they just have not been renamed to get our extension
6-some people on youtube claim to decrypt our encrytped file (they even make fake videos), all they do is message us , claim to be the real client ( you) get free test files from us and show them as proof to you (if you message us we will tell you what the file was ) ,get money from you,but they don't pay us and will not decrypt the rest of file , they will make you wait days with different reasons until you give up or if you don't they will not answer you any more ,in simple words, when they claim a lie (decrypting our files) they are already playing you will scam you , the only safe thing you can do with no risk is message us yourself ,we will answer relieve any concern you have
