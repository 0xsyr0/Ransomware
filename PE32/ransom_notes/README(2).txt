Greetings

You have been hit with Pe32.

Pe32 is a PostQuantum resilient modern encryption app.

We have encrypted your data and exfiltrated sensitive documents.
To recover your files and prevent public disclosure of documents a payment in form of crypto currency is required.
Please note that cost for file decryption and avoiding data publification is separate.

To establish trust and provide assurance, we offer the following:

A decryption test for a few small files (less than 1-2 MB) that do not contain valuable information.
Screenshot of other customers who have paid and received decryption. For larger payments you may also request information for individuals from your country who have successfully decrypted their data as proof.

Pricing:
Single servers: $700 - $7000
Companies and Multiple Computers: $10,000 to more than 2btc and more, depending on the data size and company.

Delaying contact will increase the cost and make it more difficult for you.
