>>> KIND ADVICES
  - Sir, do not waste your time going to “recovery companies”, they are just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you. 
  
- We respect your time, money and highly disrespect “recovery companies”, who contact us to buy decryption software and … sell it to you many times more expensive or scam you.

  - Do not hesitate for a long time. The faster you pay, the lower the price.

 - Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files.
