>> YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED <<

All of your documents, databases, photos, and other important files have been encrypted with a military-grade algorithm.  
You are not able to access them anymore.

To restore your files:
1. Do NOT attempt to rename or decrypt the files manually. Any modification may result in permanent data loss.
2. Do NOT turn off or reinstall your system. This will NOT help you.
3. The only way to recover your files is to purchase a unique decryption key from us.

We've stolen important documents from your company, and we know that publishing them on our "DARKWEB" website could be harmful to you.

But don't worry, we have a solution! Contact us by email to obtain payment. We've recovered your important documents from "ONE DRIVE," such as invoices, passports, PDF, Excel, TXT files, images, and more.
If you don't believe us, we can wait and see what happens to your company and when these files are made public on the internet.
You can email us to request access to some of the stolen information and documents.
We've gained access to your RDP NAS, your usernames and passwords, as well as your WhatsApp account with all the data and information it contained. So, you know what we have now.

You have 72 hours to contact us, otherwise the decryption key will be deleted permanently and your data will be lost forever.

To get your key:
Contact us via the email :

Your system ID:  0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Note: You can upload up to 2 small files (<1MB) for free decryption to prove we can recover your files.

We are the only ones who can help you. Any attempt to use third-party recovery tools will fail.
