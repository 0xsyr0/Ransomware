>> YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED <<

All of your documents, databases, photos, and other important files have been encrypted with a military-grade algorithm.  
You are not able to access them anymore.

To restore your files:
1. Do NOT attempt to rename or decrypt the files manually. Any modification may result in permanent data loss.
2. Do NOT turn off or reinstall your system. This will NOT help you.
3. The only way to recover your files is to purchase a unique decryption key from us.

You have 72 hours to contact us, otherwise the decryption key will be deleted permanently and your data will be lost forever.

We are the only ones who can help you. Any attempt to use third-party recovery tools will fail.
