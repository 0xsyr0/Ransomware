 What guarantee is there that we won't cheat you?
We are the oldest ransomware affiliate program on the planet, nothing is more important than our reputation.
We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money.
If you pay, we will provide you with decryption software and destroy the stolen data.
After you pay the ransom, you will quickly make even more money.
Treat this situation simply as a paid training for your system administrators, because it is due to your corporate network not being properly configured that we were able to attack you.
Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators.
 Get over it and pay for it.
If we don't give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future.

They won't help and will only make things worse for you.
In 3 years not a single member of our group has been caught by the police, we are top notch hackers and we never leave a trail of crime.
The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way.
The first thing they will tell you is that there is no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files, this is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it is a matter.
It is very beneficial for the police and FBI to let everyone on the planet know about your data leak because then your state will get the fines budgeted for you due to GDPR and other similar laws.
The fines will be used to fund the police and the FBI, they will eat more sweet coffee donuts and get fatter and fatter.
The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we will help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money.
Along with this you should know that it is not necessarily your company that has to pay the ransom and not necessarily from your bank account, it can be done by an unidentified person, such as any philanthropist who loves your company, for example, Elon Musk, so the police will not do anything to you if someone pays the ransom for you.
If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom.
The police and FBI will not be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information.
The police and FBI will not protect you from repeated attacks.

Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.
>>>>> What are the dangers of leaking your company's data.
First of all, you will receive fines from the government such as the GDRPand many others, you can be sued by customers of your firm for leaking information that was confidential.
Your leaked data will be used by all the hackers on the planet for various unpleasant things.
For example, social engineering, your employees personal data can be used to re-infiltrate your company.
Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through which criminal money will be laundered.
On another vacation trip, you will have to explain to the FBI where you got millions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency
